Université Paris-Saclay is committed to taking an approach that promotes strong values and is mindful of developing a trusting, constructive relationship between science and society. In this way, it asserts its identity as a responsible university, as well as its desire to create favorable conditions for thoughtful research that serves the common good. POLÉTHIS calls upon the skills and expertise of the entire university community to offer training on issues surrounding research ethics and scientific integrity, within the networks that unite various elements at Paris-Saclay. Within the framework of a dedicated committee, POLÉTHIS offers researchers support in terms of monitoring developments in ethical subjects and consultation in order to anticipate the ethical aspects and social impact of their research projects. Through seminars, thematic working groups, and colloquia, POLÉTHIS strives to produce innovative research and ethical initiatives adapted to the needs of teams and the standards of responsible, honest research. It also seeks to achieve honest scientific production, with honorable practices that respect inarguable principles. Scientific integrity lies in upholding personal and institutional standards in collaborative relationships as much as in the relevance and fairness of research work.

The 4 areas of action of POLÉTHIS The scientific integrity network This network, which unites the points of contact for scientific integrity from Université Paris-Saclay establishments, is a forum for discussion, sharing experience, and giving advice for addressing scientific integrity violations. At the service of the entire community, scientific integrity contacts provide advice and instruct on circumstances falling within their field of expertise. The network also proactively recommends training on scientific integrity for doctoral candidates and supervisors. The approach encourages awareness, training, and prevention in an effort to develop research concerned with rigor, fairness, and integrity. The research ethics and scientific integrity training network In accordance with the May 25, 2016 decree establishing the national training framework and the conditions for obtaining a nationally recognized doctoral degree, the network provides training in research ethics and scientific integrity for doctoral candidates enrolled at Université Paris-Saclay. The training is both theoretical and practical, general and specialized, imparting references, knowledge, and expertise (especially for first-year students), as well as providing an on-going reflection developed in research situations, notably in the context of teams and laboratories. The goal is for each individual to incorporate the knowledge necessary for practicing responsible science. Think tank and research network on the ethics of research/science and science integrity, promotion, and prospective studies Eager to promote shared ethical reflection and a vital research dynamic within Université Paris-Saclay, the network is open to all research teams and units. It offers to organize community-building events (seminars, theme days, colloquia) with them and to support those initiatives that fall within its field of expertise. It carries out literature reviews and facilitates prospective studies and thematic research within a “laboratory of ideas” approach. Comité d’éthique de la recherche de l’Université Paris Saclay (Université Paris-Saclay Ethics Assessment Committee) (CER-PS) The Université Paris-Saclay Ethics Assessment Committee examines the ethical aspects of non-interventional research projects, with the exception of research targeting the development of biological and medical knowledge, when this research directly or indirectly involves human participants. CER-PS advisory opinions are delivered following an expert assessment of research protocols based on an ethical analysis of objectives, methods, and, more specifically, terms and conditions of inclusion, information, consent, collection and preservation of data, respect for confidentiality, protection and respect for dignity, integrity, and the rights of persons during research activities.
