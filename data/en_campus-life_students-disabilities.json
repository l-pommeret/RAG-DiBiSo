The Disability and Studies Department is aimed at students with all disabilities, whether motor, sensory or psychological. The University’s disability advisors coordinate all efforts in order to identify your research projects, analyse your needs and prepare a personalised assistance and adaptation plan. Suggested and applicable course accommodations aim to offset the student’s disability. Additionally, students who have received accommodations are subject to the University’s general rules. Suggested procedures and measures draw on: the Disability and Studies (SHE) Unit the University Department of Preventative Medicine (SUMPPS) the network of Disability Advisors in constituent faculties. Formalities At Université Paris-Saclay, a disabled student may be able to receive course/exam accommodations. They may also receive support throughout their course by the Disability Service. For this, the student should be recognised as a student with specific needs by the University Department of Preventative Medicine (SUMPPS). Arrangements should be made as soon as possible at the beginning of the semester, so that appropriate accommodations can be made. Process All requests for accommodations must be sent to your constituent faculty’s disability service within 15 days of registering at the University. If a disability (even a temporary one) or a disabling illness occurs during the course of the year, the request for accommodations to examinations must be submitted no later than 15 days before the start of the first exam. - After administrative registration, any students who would like to receive a or several specific accommodations should contact the Disability Advisor in their constituent faculty. - Once registration has finished, the student should also book an appointment with a doctor at the University Department of Preventative Medicine so that we can assess their accommodation needs. On the day of the appointment, they should bring their student card, as well as their medical file if possible. The student will explain their accommodation request to the doctor (course and exam conditions). - Following this meeting, the doctor at the SUMPPS will prepare a medical certificate which suggests accommodations (study and examination conditions) according to the student’s specific needs. This certificate should be sent to the student’s constituent faculty’s Disability Advisor. The list of these advisors is available in the Vie de Campus/Handicap section on the website. This medical certificate should only mention accommodations to be put in place. Personal and/or medical information which has been used while creating the certificate is kept confidential respectively by the SUMPPS and the SHE. - When specific teaching measures are proposed and require an opinion from different support services at the university (doctor, disability service, teaching team, student, etc.), these players form a ‘multi-actor team’. This team will come together to outline the most suitable specific measures to implement, in order to ensure that learning remains accessible. - The Director, the Dean of the faculty, based on recommendations from the SUMPPS and the Disability Service, will authorise the student to receive accommodations. This authorisation takes form in a PAEH, drawn up by the SHE with the constituent faculties, that summaries the accommodations to be implemented.
