To log in to your library account, please use your Paris-Saclay login details (firstname.lastname and corresponding password). You will also find your search history and reading history. View the "Borrow" page to find out how many documents you can borrow and for how long. You can also extend your loans online through your library account. Most documents can be renewed once (14 or 28 days, depending on your profile). Only high-demand documents (pharmacy journals, legal codes and ENCi manuals) cannot be renewed. You cannot renew a document if it has been reserved by another reader, if the document is already overdue or you are currently suspended. Remember to extend your books before it's too late! You will receive emails informing you when the document return date is approaching. All these procedures can also be carried out over the phone by calling your UL reception desk or on site by speaking to your librarian at the loan desks. To extend your documents, log in to your library account, click on the "Loans" tab, then on "Extend". Documents must be returned to the libraries from where they were borrowed. There are document return boxes at Orsay UL and Sceaux UL allowing you to drop off your books when the library is closed.
