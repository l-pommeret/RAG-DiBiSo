Home services Request a discharge Request a discharge <h1 class="text-align-center"><a class="btn btn-primary" href=" https://quitus.biblio.univ-evry.fr/saclay " target="_blank">Obtaining your discharge online</a></h1> A discharge from the Department of Libraries, Information and Open Science is required by the Registrar's Office for any file transfer, student re-registration or graduation. This discharge can only be issued after the return or reimbursement of all borrowed documents. Requesting this discharge will result in the closure of your library account, and consequently, no further loans will be possible until you are re-registered with our libraries. Students of CentraleSup√©lec and ENS Paris-Saclay must use the form for former students. In case of difficulties, please contact: bib.univ@universite-paris-saclay.fr . Make sure to include your full name and student number.
